### Fragmented Liquidity and Limited Transfer Pathways

**Traditional remittance systems often operate within isolated corridors with fragmented liquidity**, limiting user options and forcing them to use different platforms for different purposes. In the Web3 context, similar challenges arise when assets are fragmented across various chains, making value transfers complicated and expensive, ultimately hindering capital efficiency and users' ability to access optimal exchange rates or the best transfer routes. NusaPay addresses this by **facilitating seamless cross-country and cross-currency liquidity access**, enabling the direct conversion of USDC from various blockchains (which can be accessed through a MetaMask interface) to specific local currencies and direct deposits into local bank accounts, empowering users to navigate these financial ecosystems without these barriers.

### 

[](https://nusapay.gitbook.io/nusapay-on-metamask/introduction/problem#slow-and-costly-conversion-burning-and-payout-processes)

### Slow & Costly Conversion, "Burning," and Payout Processes

**Traditional cross-border fund transfer mechanisms and even some early crypto-to-fiat solutions often involve numerous intermediaries, lengthy confirmation processes, and hidden fees**. Stages such as currency conversion, bank clearing processes, and final deposits can take days, leading to significant inefficiencies and high operational costs. **NusaPay mitigates this through optimized and automated smart contract execution**, where the entire transaction cycle is executed **efficiently and transparently,** ensuring rapid and secure confirmation.

###

NusaPay Cross-border Diagram Flow

We achieve seamless cross-border capability by intelligently managing the movement of value from the user's Web3 wallet to various blockchains up to the final settlement in local fiat currency. This is a multi-stage process that is fully transparent and optimized for efficiency. Our robust cross-chain infrastructure leverages technologies like Chainlink CCIP for specific high-assurance transfers (as illustrated by the automated payroll flow), and integrates the LI.FI SDK/API for broader asset bridging and routing across diverse networks. This versatile architecture is designed to facilitate the conversion and payout into various local fiat currencies, extending beyond specific examples like IDR and its token representation (e.g., IDRX).

### 

[](https://nusapay.gitbook.io/nusapay-on-metamask/how-it-works/how-we-achieve-cross-border-capability#id-1.-initiating-cross-chain-payment-from-employer-via-arbitrum)

### 1\. Initiating Cross-Chain Payment (from Employer via Arbitrum)

-   The process begins when an Employer sends USDC (along with payroll data) from their Web3 wallet to the Payroll Smart Contract (SC) deployed on Arbitrum.
    
-   The Payroll SC (Arbitrum) then initiates the transfer of this USDC to the Base chain using Chainlink CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol).
    

### 

[](https://nusapay.gitbook.io/nusapay-on-metamask/how-it-works/how-we-achieve-cross-border-capability#id-2.-secure-cross-chain-transfer-via-chainlink-ccip-to-base)

### 2\. Secure Cross-Chain Transfer via Chainlink CCIP to Base

-   Chainlink CCIP plays a crucial role in facilitating the secure and trustless transfer of USDC from Arbitrum to the IDRX Smart Contract (SC) deployed on Base. This ensures data and value integrity during cross-chain transit.
    
-   Upon completion of the transfer, USDC enters the IDRX SC on Base.
    

### 

[](https://nusapay.gitbook.io/nusapay-on-metamask/how-it-works/how-we-achieve-cross-border-capability#id-3.-on-chain-activity-detection-and-fiat-payout-orchestration)

### 3\. On-Chain Activity Detection & Fiat Payout Orchestration

-   As soon as USDC enters the IDRX SC (Base), this smart contract automatically emits a deposit event. This event is an on-chain signal indicating the receipt of funds.
    
-   The IDRX Backend actively listens for the deposit event emitted by the IDRX SC on Base. When the event is detected, it triggers the subsequent off-chain process.
    

### 

[](https://nusapay.gitbook.io/nusapay-on-metamask/how-it-works/how-we-achieve-cross-border-capability#id-4.-internal-conversion-and-fiat-transfer-to-employees-account)

### 4\. Internal Conversion & Fiat Transfer to Employee's Account

-   Based on the event from the IDRX SC, the IDRX Backend then converts the received USDC value into the local fiat currency (IDR).
    
-   Subsequently, the IDRX Backend transfers the IDR directly to the Employee's bank account, with Bank Indonesia (or the relevant local bank) facilitating the final deposit. This results in the salary entering the employee's account.
    

### 

[](https://nusapay.gitbook.io/nusapay-on-metamask/how-it-works/how-we-achieve-cross-border-capability#id-5.-verification-and-transparency)

### 5\. Verification & Transparency

-   Every key step of this flow—from initiation on Arbitrum, cross-chain transfer via CCIP, to receipt on IDRX SC Base, and event triggering—is recorded and verified on the blockchain. This ensures a transparent and immutable audit trail, allowing real-time monitoring of transaction status.

## NusaPay's Cross-Chain Strategy & LI.FI Integration

NusaPay's power lies in its ability to operate seamlessly across various blockchain networks, addressing the inherent fragmentation of liquidity and assets in the Web3 ecosystem. Our cross-chain strategy ensures that users can initiate payments from their preferred chain, and funds can efficiently reach their destination regardless of the underlying network.

### 

[](https://nusapay.gitbook.io/nusapay-on-metamask/nusapays-cross-chain-strategy-and-li.fi-integration#why-cross-chain-interoperability-is-crucial-for-nusapay)

### Why Cross-Chain Interoperability is Crucial for NusaPay

The world of digital assets is multi-chain, with liquidity spread across numerous networks. For a global payment protocol like NusaPay, confining operations to a single chain would severely limit its reach and utility. Cross-chain interoperability allows us to:

-   **Access Broader Liquidity**: Tap into asset pools across multiple blockchains.
    
-   **Offer User Flexibility**: Enable users to send funds from whichever chain holds their assets.
    
-   **Optimize Efficiency**: Find the most cost-effective and fastest routes for value transfer.
    
-   **Enhance Composability**: Allow NusaPay to be integrated into dApps built on diverse ecosystems.
    

### 

[](https://nusapay.gitbook.io/nusapay-on-metamask/nusapays-cross-chain-strategy-and-li.fi-integration#leveraging-li.fi-for-seamless-interoperability)

### Leveraging LI.FI for Seamless Interoperability

While Chainlink CCIP provides a robust solution for high-assurance, specific cross-chain transfers (as demonstrated in our payroll example from Arbitrum to Base), NusaPay further enhances its cross-chain capabilities by integrating the LI.FI SDK/API. LI.FI acts as a bridge and DEX aggregator, enabling NusaPay to:

-   **Support a Wide Range of Chains**: Connect to a broad spectrum of EVM-compatible and other blockchain networks.
    
-   **Optimize Bridging and Swapping**: Automatically identify and utilize the best available bridges and decentralized exchanges to facilitate asset transfers and swaps across different chains with minimal slippage.
    
-   **Simplify Complex Routes**: Abstract away the complexity of multi-step cross-chain transactions (e.g., bridging, then swapping) for the end-user, presenting a single, seamless interaction.
    

### 

[](https://nusapay.gitbook.io/nusapay-on-metamask/nusapays-cross-chain-strategy-and-li.fi-integration#how-li.fi-complements-our-architecture)

### How LI.FI Complements Our Architecture

LI.FI plays a vital role in scenarios beyond direct payroll transfers shown in the diagram, for instance:

-   **Diverse Asset Ingestion**: If a user holds USDC on a chain not directly supported by our primary Chainlink CCIP route, LI.FI can facilitate the bridging of that USDC to a compatible source chain (like Arbitrum in our example), from where the standard payroll flow can commence.
    
-   **Flexible Source Chains**: It enables NusaPay to accept payments originating from a much wider array of blockchains, significantly expanding our service coverage.
    
-   **Dynamic Routing**: For general cross-chain transfers or where specific asset-to-asset swaps across chains are needed, LI.FI provides the intelligence to route these transactions efficiently.
    

By strategically combining specialized solutions like Chainlink CCIP for core flows and general-purpose aggregators like LI.FI for broader interoperability, NusaPay builds a truly robust and adaptable cross-border payment infrastructure.

### 

[](https://nusapay.gitbook.io/nusapay-on-metamask/automated-international-payroll-and-cross-border-payouts#efficient-payout-execution)

### Efficient Payout Execution

-   **Select Recipient:** Once recipient profiles are set up, users can easily select a recipient from their saved list.
    
-   **Enter Amount:** The amount of funds to be disbursed is entered, and the system automatically calculates the conversion to the local currency.
    
-   **Confirm Transaction with MetaMask:** Users review details and confirm the transaction via their MetaMask wallet, including approving the token and digitally signing to authorize the payment.
    

### 

[](https://nusapay.gitbook.io/nusapay-on-metamask/automated-international-payroll-and-cross-border-payouts#automation-and-data-reusability-for-scalability)

### Automation & Data Reusability for Scalability

-   **Recipient Data Storage:** NusaPay intelligently stores recipient details (name, bank account, etc.) from each transaction input in a secure database. This eliminates the need to re-enter the same information for future payments, ideal for recurring payroll.
    
-   **Comprehensive Transaction History:** All transactions are recorded in a detailed and accessible history, allowing users to track payment status in real-time and access historical records at any time. Each transaction also has an on-chain transaction hash for full transparency.
    
-   **Schedule & Reuse Payments**: With saved recipient data, users can quickly "make payments" repeatedly by simply calling up the recipient's name. This significantly reduces the administrative burden for international payroll or mass payouts, making NusaPay an ideal solution for modern businesses.
